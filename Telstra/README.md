## Competition Details
In their first recruiting competition, Telstra is challenging Kagglers to predict the severity of service disruptions on their network. Using a dataset of features from their service logs, you're tasked with predicting if a disruption is a momentary glitch or a total interruption of connectivity.

Telstra is on a journey to enhance the customer experience - ensuring everyone in the company is putting customers first. In terms of its expansive network, this means continuously advancing how it predicts the scope and timing of service disruptions. Telstra wants to see how you would help it drive customer advocacy by developing a more advanced predictive model for service disruptions and to help it better serve its customers.
